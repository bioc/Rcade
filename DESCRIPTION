Description: Rcade (which stands for "R-based analysis of ChIP-seq And
        Differential Expression") is a tool for integrating ChIP-seq
        data with differential expression summary data, through a
        Bayesian framework. A key application is in identifing the
        genes targeted by a transcription factor of interest - that is,
        we collect genes that are associated with a ChIP-seq peak, and
        differential expression under some perturbation related to that
        TF.
